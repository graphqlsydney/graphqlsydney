If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention graphqlsydney to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] **__Thank you!__**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future GraphQL Sydney...

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **__SPEAKERS!__**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at GraphQL Sydney because presenting her is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Sydney GraphQL community would love to hear about...

---

# [fit] **__Where do I sign up?__**

- *`https://github.com/graphqlsydney/graphqlsydney/issues`*
- *`@paulfioravanti`*
- *`@joshprice`*

^
- Open up an issue at the GraphQL Sydney Github repo and tell us all about what you would like to talk about.
- Or, feel free to tweet at any of the GraphQL Sydney organisers on Twitter.<br />
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the GraphQL Sydney organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] *We're on*
# [fit] **__YouTube!__**
# [fit] `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEvNUjmt8KoeYY5L51HBRg`

^
GraphQL Australia has a YouTube channel where recordings of talks from at least this meetup go up, and we're definitely happy to have videos uploaded from other GraphQL meetups from around Australia, so if you are a regional meetup organiser or know one who has talk videos that need a home, please reach out.<br />
Either go to the URL you can see on the slide, or just do a search for GraphQL Australia and you'll be sure to find us. Don't forget to like and subscribe, as we'd love to get up to 100 subscribers so we can get one of those fancy custom URLs, rather than the bland ID that we have.
