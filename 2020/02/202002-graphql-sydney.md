If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention graphqlsydney to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

So if you're new to GraphQL Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] **_Thank you!_**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future GraphQL Sydney...

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **_SPEAKERS!_**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at GraphQL Sydney because presenting her is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Sydney GraphQL community would love to hear about...
